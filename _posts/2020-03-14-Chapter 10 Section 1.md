# Chapter 10 Section 1

<ad here> 

## Differences Between North and South 

Senator Calhoun argued that **N** & **S** had been politically equal when Constitution first adopted. 

- Now became diff. by developing different ways of life in 1850s. 

North: Industrialized Society 

- **Factories** turned out ever-increasing amounts of products 
  - Textiles / Sewing Machines / Farm Equipment / Guns / etc.  
- More than 20,000 miles of **Railroad track** laid during the 1850s. 
  - Sent manufactured goods west / Sent raw materials east. 
- Small Towns → **Cities** overnight b/c many people arrived with railroads 
  - Telegraph Wires strung along with Railroad : Provided Instant communication with North. 
- Immigrants from Europe entered the industrial workplace 
  - ***X* liked slavery** (2 reasons) : direct competition with free labor / reduce status of white workers who cannot compete with slaves. 

------

South : Agriculture / Slavery (Rural Society)

- Consist mostly **plantations** and **Small Farms**. 
  - Economy relied on staple crops. 
         ex) Cotton 
- Used rivers to transport goods (Ship)
  - *X* used railroad even though it was expanding 
- Few immigrants settled in South. 
  - African Americans met most of the available need for artisans / mechanics / laborers 
    - Even few settlers displayed **significant opposition** to slavery. 
- *X* Created Manufactured goods. 
  - **1/3** of population lived in South / only **10%** of manufactured goods was produced in South. 

South was rattling with conflict over Slavery. 

- Mississippi / Louisiana / South Carolina : African Americans were the majority. 

## Slavery In the Territories 

Aug. 8, 1846, Pennsylvania Democrat **David Wilmot** heightened tensions between North & South. 

- Introduced Bill called **Wilmot Proviso**
  - Meant that California / Utah / New Mexico would be closed to slavery forever.   

**Wilmot Proviso** : divided Congress along regional lines. 

- Northerners : angry over refusal of Southern congressmen to vote for **internal improvements**.
  ex) building of canals, roads. (supported by the proviso) 
  - Feared that adding slave territory would give slave states more power. 
- Southerners : opposed the proviso / raised complex constitutional issues. 
  - Feared that power would shift permanently to North. 
    - House of Rep. approved Proviso, but Senate rejected it. 

Alexander H. Stephans's (Georgia Congressman) Dire Prediction 

> The North is going to stick the Wilmot amendment to every appropriation and then all the South will vote against any measure thus clogged. Finally a tremendous struggle will take place and perhaps [President] Polk in starting one war may find half a dozen on his hands. I tell you the prospect ahead is dark, cloudy, thick and gloomy.

------

**Gold Rush** in California had grown in population so fast → Skipped territorial phase of becoming a state. 

- Late 1850, held constitutional convention / adopted state constitution / elected governor & legislature | applied to Union. 
- Constitution banned slavery : alarmed Southern States b/c they assumed California will be slave state. 
  - Assumed b/c California laid south of the Missouri Compromise line ( 36˚30’ ). 
  - Zachary Taylor : Supported California's admission as a free state. 

## The Senate Debates 

31st Congress opened in December 1849 

- An atmosphere of distrust of distrust and bitterness. 
- Southerners accused the North of failing to enforce the **Fugitive Slave Act of 1793**.
  - Threatened by **Secession** / formal withdrawal of a state from the Union 

**Clay's Compromise** : Clay worked night and day to Shape compromise 

- Obtained Webster's support. 
- For North: California be admitted to the Union as a free state. 
- For South: Proposed New and more effective fugitive slave law. 
- Other provisions had elements that appealed to both regions. 
  - Allowed New Mexico & Utah Popular Sovereignty. 
  - Fed. gov. pay Texas $10mil. to surrender its claim to New Mexico
  - North: Limited Slavery to curr. boarder / South: Money would help to pay debt for Mexico War. 

Feb. 5, Clay defended his resolution and begged both side to consider them thoughtfully. (Alternative : disunion). 

- Senate rejected compromise 

**Stephen A. Douglas** : Picked up pro-compromise reins / unbundled the package of resolutions & reintroduced them. 

- Unexpected death of **President Taylor** on July 9 aided Douglas's efforts. 
- **Millard Fillmore**(Taylor's successor) cleared that he supported the compromise / South was ready to negotiate.
  - Able to settle down the compromise.
